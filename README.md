Nowhere encodes an entire website into a URL fragment. The site lives in the link itself and is never stored on a server. Eight tools (event, fundraiser, store, petition, message, drop, art, forum) publish without accounts or platform permission. Orders and messages route through Nostr relays using ephemeral keys.

**Status:** Nowhere is early software and still evolving. There may be bugs in any tool. Store carries the most risk because it handles real money and depends on Nostr relays that may not retain orders, so test the full flow including order retrieval before using it for real business.

## How it works

A URL fragment is the part after `#`. The HTTP specification prohibits browsers from sending fragments to servers. The server that delivers the page never receives the content, never knows which site you are viewing, and has no way to find out. No content is collected, stored, or logged. The privacy is structural.

A site that was never put on a server can never be taken off one. There is no account to suspend, no host to pressure, no platform that can decide your content should not exist. Each copy of the link is a complete copy of the site data.

Site creators can encrypt the URL itself with a password. Even possessing the link reveals nothing about what is inside.

## The eight tools

| Tool | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Event** | An event poster, printable as a QR code |
| **Fundraiser** | A donation page with a goal and payment details |
| **Store** | A full catalogue with checkout over Nostr |
| **Petition** | A demand with signatures that no platform can remove |
| **Message** | A letter delivered entirely in the link |
| **Drop** | A text file, from notes to code |
| **Art** | An SVG canvas that renders from the link |
| **Forum** | A private board with topics and live chat |

Every tool can be cryptographically signed by its creator and password-encrypted at the URL. Where a tool uses Nostr for live communication (store, forum, petition), the relay traffic is always NIP-44 encrypted.

## Encoding

Data is serialized into a compact text format, then compressed through dictionary substitution (common words and phrases replaced with short codes) and raw DEFLATE (pako). The result is base64url-encoded into the fragment. A single-item store fits in about 120 characters.

Decoding is the reverse, entirely in the browser.

## Offline

No server means no signal required. Print a nowhere link as a QR code and it carries a complete event, fundraiser, message, drop, or artwork, readable with the [nowhr.xyz](https://nowhr.xyz/install) app on a device with no internet connection at all.

## Nostr

Five of the eight site types are purely static. The store, forum, and petition need live communication (orders, posts, signatures) and use Nostr relays for that. All relay traffic is NIP-44 encrypted. The relay stores events it cannot read, from throwaway keys it cannot trace, for sites it cannot identify.

## Project structure

```
nowhere/packages/codec/    Encoding and decoding. Pure TypeScript, no UI.
nowhere/packages/web/      Svelte 5 components for building and rendering sites.
nowhr/                     App shell with routing, PWA, QR scanner.
```

The repo is a pnpm workspace. Codec is standalone: any application that wants to read or create nowhere data only needs this package. Web is the component library with builders, renderers, Nostr integration, and payment handling. nowhr wires web into a deployable static site at [nowhr.xyz](https://nowhr.xyz/app).

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN` | `window.location.origin` | Canonical origin used for share links, QR codes, og:image URLs, and instance detection. Optional build-time override. |

By default the app uses `window.location.origin` at runtime, so deploying to any domain works automatically — no env var needed. If you need to pin the origin to a value that differs from the serving domain (e.g. for pre-rendering or build-time inlining), set it before building:

```
PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN=https://my-instance.example pnpm build
```

The signing prefix in `nowhere-signing.ts` (`NOWHERE_PREFIX`) is a protocol constant and is **not** affected by this variable.

## Running locally

```
pnpm install
cd nowhr
pnpm dev                                           # localhost:5174
PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN=https://custom.dev pnpm dev     # custom origin
pnpm build                                          # outputs to nowhr/build/
```

Requires Node.js 20+ and pnpm 10+.
